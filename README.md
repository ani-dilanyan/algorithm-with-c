# Algorithms in C

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of fundamental algorithms implemented in the C programming language. It serves as a learning resource for understanding and practicing various algorithmic concepts, including sorting, searching, and data structures.

## 📂 Contents

- **Sorting Algorithms**
  - Bubble Sort (standard, recursive, linked list)
  - Insertion Sort (standard, linked list)
  - Selection Sort (standard, recursive, linked list)
  - Merge Sort (linked list)
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort

- **Data Structures**
  - Stack (e.g., decimal to binary conversion)
  - Queue (e.g., palindrome checker, printer simulation, customer service simulation)

*(Note: Additional algorithms and data structures can be added as the repository evolves.)*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Programming Language: **C**
- Compiler: `gcc` or any standard C compiler

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ani-dilanyan/algorithm-with-c.git
   cd algorithm-with-c
2. **Compile and run a program:**
   ```bash
   gcc BubbleSort.c -o BubbleSort
   ./BubbleSort

  (Replace BubbleSort.c with the desired source file.)
